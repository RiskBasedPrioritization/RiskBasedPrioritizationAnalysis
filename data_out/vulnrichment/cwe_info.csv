CVE-2022-46169,,,"Cacti is an open source platform which provides a robust and extensible operational monitoring and fault management framework for users. In affected versions a command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary code on a server running Cacti, if a specific data source was selected for any monitored device. The vulnerability resides in the `remote_agent.php` file. This file can be accessed without authentication. This function retrieves the IP address of the client via `get_client_addr` and resolves this IP address to the corresponding hostname via `gethostbyaddr`. After this, it is verified that an entry within the `poller` table exists, where the hostname corresponds to the resolved hostname. If such an entry was found, the function returns `true` and the client is authorized. This authorization can be bypassed due to the implementation of the `get_client_addr` function. The function is defined in the file `lib/functions.php` and checks serval `$_SERVER` variables to determine the IP address of the client. The variables beginning with `HTTP_` can be arbitrarily set by an attacker. Since there is a default entry in the `poller` table with the hostname of the server running Cacti, an attacker can bypass the authentication e.g. by providing the header `Forwarded-For: <TARGETIP>`. This way the function `get_client_addr` returns the IP address of the server running Cacti. The following call to `gethostbyaddr` will resolve this IP address to the hostname of the server, which will pass the `poller` hostname check because of the default entry. After the authorization of the `remote_agent.php` file is bypassed, an attacker can trigger different actions. One of these actions is called `polldata`. The called function `poll_for_data` retrieves a few request parameters and loads the corresponding `poller_item` entries from the database. If the `action` of a `poller_item` equals `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`, the function `proc_open` is used to execute a PHP script. The attacker-controlled parameter `$poller_id` is retrieved via the function `get_nfilter_request_var`, which allows arbitrary strings. This variable is later inserted into the string passed to `proc_open`, which leads to a command injection vulnerability. By e.g. providing the `poller_id=;id` the `id` command is executed. In order to reach the vulnerable call, the attacker must provide a `host_id` and `local_data_id`, where the `action` of the corresponding `poller_item` is set to `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP`. Both of these ids (`host_id` and `local_data_id`) can easily be bruteforced. The only requirement is that a `poller_item` with an `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` action exists. This is very likely on a productive instance because this action is added by some predefined templates like `Device - Uptime` or `Device - Polling Time`.

This command injection vulnerability allows an unauthenticated user to execute arbitrary commands if a `poller_item` with the `action` type `POLLER_ACTION_SCRIPT_PHP` (`2`) is configured. The authorization bypass should be prevented by not allowing an attacker to make `get_client_addr` (file `lib/functions.php`) return an arbitrary IP address. This could be done by not honoring the `HTTP_...` `$_SERVER` variables. If these should be kept for compatibility reasons it should at least be prevented to fake the IP address of the server running Cacti. This vulnerability has been addressed in both the 1.2.x and 1.3.x release branches with `1.2.23` being the first release containing the patch.",CWE-74,CWE-74: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Output Used by a Downstream Component ('Injection')

The root cause is:
  1. packet_snd() only reset skb->mac_header when sock->type is SOCK_RAW
     and skb->protocol is not specified as in packet_parse_headers()

  2. packet_direct_xmit() doesn't reset skb->mac_header as dev_queue_xmit()

In this case, skb->mac_header is 65535 when ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2() is
called. So when ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2() gets mac header with eth_hdr() which
use ""skb->head + skb->mac_header"", out-of-bound access occurs.

This patch replaces eth_hdr() with skb_eth_hdr() in ipvlan_xmit_mode_l2()
and reset mac header in multicast to solve this out-of-bound bug.",,

CVE-2024-35814,CWE-119,CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

swiotlb: Fix double-allocation of slots due to broken alignment handling

Commit bbb73a103fbb (""swiotlb: fix a braino in the alignment check fix""),
which was a fix for commit 0eee5ae10256 (""swiotlb: fix slot alignment
checks""), causes a functional regression with vsock in a virtual machine
using bouncing via a restricted DMA SWIOTLB pool.

When virtio allocates the virtqueues for the vsock device using
dma_alloc_coherent(), the SWIOTLB search can return page-unaligned
allocations if 'area->index' was left unaligned by a previous allocation
from the buffer:

 # Final address in brackets is the SWIOTLB address returned to the caller
 | virtio-pci 0000:00:07.0: orig_addr 0x0 alloc_size 0x2000, iotlb_align_mask 0x800 stride 0x2: got slot 1645-1649/7168 (0x98326800)
 | virtio-pci 0000:00:07.0: orig_addr 0x0 alloc_size 0x2000, iotlb_align_mask 0x800 stride 0x2: got slot 1649-1653/7168 (0x98328800)
 | virtio-pci 0000:00:07.0: orig_addr 0x0 alloc_size 0x2000, iotlb_align_mask 0x800 stride 0x2: got slot 1653-1657/7168 (0x9832a800)

This ends badly (typically buffer corruption and/or a hang) because
swiotlb_alloc() is expecting a page-aligned allocation and so blindly
returns a pointer to the 'struct page' corresponding to the allocation,
therefore double-allocating the first half (2KiB slot) of the 4KiB page.

Fix the problem by treating the allocation alignment separately to any
additional alignment requirements from the device, using the maximum
of the two as the stride to search the buffer slots and taking care
to ensure a minimum of page-alignment for buffers larger than a page.

This also resolves swiotlb allocation failures occuring due to the

CVE-2024-35814,CWE-1055,CWE-1055 Multiple Inheritance from Concrete Classes,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

swiotlb: Fix double-allocation of slots due to broken alignment handling

Commit bbb73a103fbb (""swiotlb: fix a braino in the alignment check fix""),
which was a fix for commit 0eee5ae10256 (""swiotlb: fix slot alignment
checks""), causes a functional regression with vsock in a virtual machine
using bouncing via a restricted DMA SWIOTLB pool.

When virtio allocates the virtqueues for the vsock device using
dma_alloc_coherent(), the SWIOTLB search can return page-unaligned
allocations if 'area->index' was left unaligned by a previous allocation
from the buffer:

 # Final address in brackets is the SWIOTLB address returned to the caller
 | virtio-pci 0000:00:07.0: orig_addr 0x0 alloc_size 0x2000, iotlb_align_mask 0x800 stride 0x2: got slot 1645-1649/7168 (0x98326800)
 | virtio-pci 0000:00:07.0: orig_addr 0x0 alloc_size 0x2000, iotlb_align_mask 0x800 stride 0x2: got slot 1649-1653/7168 (0x98328800)
 | virtio-pci 0000:00:07.0: orig_addr 0x0 alloc_size 0x2000, iotlb_align_mask 0x800 stride 0x2: got slot 1653-1657/7168 (0x9832a800)

This ends badly (typically buffer corruption and/or a hang) because
swiotlb_alloc() is expecting a page-aligned allocation and so blindly
returns a pointer to the 'struct page' corresponding to the allocation,
therefore double-allocating the first half (2KiB slot) of the 4KiB page.

Fix the problem by treating the allocation alignment separately to any
additional alignment requirements from the device, using the maximum
of the two as the stride to search the buffer slots and taking care
to ensure a minimum of page-alignment for buffers larger than a page.

This also resolves swiotlb allocation failures occuring due to the
inclusion of ~PAGE_MASK in 'iotlb_align_mask' for large allocations and
resulting in alignment requirements exceeding swiotlb_max_mapping_size().",,

CVE-2024-35843,CWE-416,CWE-416 Use After Free,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

iommu/vt-d: Use device rbtree in iopf reporting path

The existing I/O page fault handler currently locates the PCI device by
calling pci_get_domain_bus_and_slot(). This function searches the list
of all PCI devices until the desired device is found. To improve lookup
efficiency, replace it with device_rbtree_find() to search the device
within the probed device rbtree.

The I/O page fault is initiated by the device, which does not have any
synchronization mechanism with the software to ensure that the device
stays in the probed device tree. Theoretically, a device could be released
by the IOMMU subsystem after device_rbtree_find() and before
iopf_get_dev_fault_param(), which would cause a use-after-free problem.

Add a mutex to synchronize the I/O page fault reporting path and the IOMMU
release device path. This lock doesn't introduce any performance overhead,
as the conflict between I/O page fault reporting and device releasing is
very rare.",,

The migrated from region is destroyed at the end of the work if the
number of credits is non-negative as the assumption is that this is
indicative of migration being complete. This assumption is incorrect as
a non-negative number of credits can also be the result of a failed

The destruction of a region that still has filters referencing it can

CVE-2024-35982,CWE-835,CWE-835 Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop'),"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

batman-adv: Avoid infinite loop trying to resize local TT

If the MTU of one of an attached interface becomes too small to transmit
the local translation table then it must be resized to fit inside all
fragments (when enabled) or a single packet.

But if the MTU becomes too low to transmit even the header + the VLAN
specific part then the resizing of the local TT will never succeed. This
can for example happen when the usable space is 110 bytes and 11 VLANs are
on top of batman-adv. In this case, at least 116 byte would be needed.
There will just be an endless spam of

   batman_adv: batadv0: Forced to purge local tt entries to fit new maximum fragment MTU (110)

in the log but the function will never finish. Problem here is that the
timeout will be halved all the time and will then stagnate at 0 and
therefore never be able to reduce the table even more.

There are other scenarios possible with a similar result. The number of
BATADV_TT_CLIENT_NOPURGE entries in the local TT can for example be too
high to fit inside a packet. Such a scenario can therefore happen also with
only a single VLAN + 7 non-purgable addresses - requiring at least 120
bytes.

While this should be handled proactively when:

* interface with too low MTU is added
* VLAN is added
* non-purgeable local mac is added
* MTU of an attached interface is reduced
* fragmentation setting gets disabled (which most likely requires dropping
  attached interfaces)

not all of these scenarios can be prevented because batman-adv is only
consuming events without the the possibility to prevent these actions
(non-purgable MAC address added, MTU of an attached interface is reduced).
It is therefore necessary to also make sure that the code is able to handle
also the situations when there were already incompatible system
configuration are present.",,

CVE-2024-35853,CWE-416,CWE-416 Use After Free,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mlxsw: spectrum_acl_tcam: Fix memory leak during rehash

The rehash delayed work migrates filters from one region to another.
This is done by iterating over all chunks (all the filters with the same
priority) in the region and in each chunk iterating over all the
filters.

If the migration fails, the code tries to migrate the filters back to
the old region. However, the rollback itself can also fail in which case
another migration will be erroneously performed. Besides the fact that
this ping pong is not a very good idea, it also creates a problem.

Each virtual chunk references two chunks: The currently used one
('vchunk->chunk') and a backup ('vchunk->chunk2'). During migration the
first holds the chunk we want to migrate filters to and the second holds
the chunk we are migrating filters from.

The code currently assumes - but does not verify - that the backup chunk
does not exist (NULL) if the currently used chunk does not reference the
target region. This assumption breaks when we are trying to rollback a
rollback, resulting in the backup chunk being overwritten and leaked
[1].

Fix by not rolling back a failed rollback and add a warning to avoid
future cases.

The Fides webserver has a number of endpoints that retrieve `ConnectionConfiguration` records and their associated `secrets` which _can_ contain sensitive data (e.g. passwords, private keys, etc.). These `secrets` are stored encrypted at rest (in the application database), and the associated endpoints are not meant to expose that sensitive data in plaintext to API clients, as it could be compromising. Fides's developers have available to them a Pydantic field-attribute (`sensitive`) that they can annotate as `True` to indicate that a given secret field should not be exposed via the API. The application has an internal function that uses `sensitive` annotations to mask the sensitive fields with a `""**********""` placeholder value. This vulnerability is due to a bug in that function, which prevented `sensitive` API model fields that were _nested_ below the root-level of a `secrets` object from being masked appropriately. Only the `BigQuery` connection configuration secrets meets these criteria: the secrets schema has a nested sensitive `keyfile_creds.private_key` property that is exposed in plaintext via the APIs. Connection types other than `BigQuery` with sensitive fields at the root-level that are not nested are properly masked with the placeholder and are not affected by this vulnerability.

CVE-2024-35960,CWE-476,CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net/mlx5: Properly link new fs rules into the tree

Previously, add_rule_fg would only add newly created rules from the
handle into the tree when they had a refcount of 1. On the other hand,
create_flow_handle tries hard to find and reference already existing
identical rules instead of creating new ones.

These two behaviors can result in a situation where create_flow_handle
1) creates a new rule and references it, then
2) in a subsequent step during the same handle creation references it
   again,
resulting in a rule with a refcount of 2 that is not linked into the
tree, will have a NULL parent and root and will result in a crash when
the flow group is deleted because del_sw_hw_rule, invoked on rule
deletion, assumes node->parent is != NULL.

This happened in the wild, due to another bug related to incorrect
handling of duplicate pkt_reformat ids, which lead to the code in
create_flow_handle incorrectly referencing a just-added rule in the same
flow handle, resulting in the problem described above. Full details are
at [1].

This patch changes add_rule_fg to add new rules without parents into
the tree, properly initializing them and avoiding the crash. This makes
it more consistent with how rules are added to an FTE in
create_flow_handle.",,

CVE-2024-35955,CWE-416,CWE-416 Use After Free,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

kprobes: Fix possible use-after-free issue on kprobe registration

When unloading a module, its state is changing MODULE_STATE_LIVE ->
 MODULE_STATE_GOING -> MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED. Each change will take
a time. `is_module_text_address()` and `__module_text_address()`
works with MODULE_STATE_LIVE and MODULE_STATE_GOING.
If we use `is_module_text_address()` and `__module_text_address()`
separately, there is a chance that the first one is succeeded but the
next one is failed because module->state becomes MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED
between those operations.

In `check_kprobe_address_safe()`, if the second `__module_text_address()`
is failed, that is ignored because it expected a kernel_text address.
But it may have failed simply because module->state has been changed
to MODULE_STATE_UNFORMED. In this case, arm_kprobe() will try to modify
non-exist module text address (use-after-free).

To fix this problem, we should not use separated `is_module_text_address()`
and `__module_text_address()`, but use only `__module_text_address()`
once and do `try_module_get(module)` which is only available with
MODULE_STATE_LIVE.",,

The flag I2C_HID_READ_PENDING is used to serialize I2C operations.
However, this is not necessary, because I2C core already has its own
locking for that.

More importantly, this flag can cause a lock-up: if the flag is set in
i2c_hid_xfer() and an interrupt happens, the interrupt handler
(i2c_hid_irq) will check this flag and return immediately without doing
anything, then the interrupt handler will be invoked again in an
infinite loop.

Since interrupt handler is an RT task, it takes over the CPU and the
flag-clearing task never gets scheduled, thus we have a lock-up.

CVE-2024-35196,,,"Sentry is a developer-first error tracking and performance monitoring platform. Sentry's Slack integration incorrectly records the incoming request body in logs. This request data can contain sensitive information, including the deprecated Slack verification token. With this verification token, it is possible under specific configurations, an attacker can forge requests and act as the Slack integration. The request body is leaked in log entries matching `event == ""slack.*"" && name == ""sentry.integrations.slack"" && request_data == *`. The deprecated slack verification token, will be found in the `request_data.token` key. **SaaS users** do not need to take any action. **Self-hosted users** should upgrade to version 24.5.0 or higher, rotate their Slack verification token, and use the Slack Signing Secret instead of the verification token. For users only using the `slack.signing-secret` in their self-hosted configuration, the legacy verification token is not used to verify the webhook payload. It is ignored. Users unable to upgrade should either set the `slack.signing-secret` instead of `slack.verification-token`. The signing secret is Slack's recommended way of authenticating webhooks. By having `slack.singing-secret` set, Sentry self-hosted will no longer use the verification token for authentication of the webhooks, regardless of whether `slack.verification-token` is set or not. Alternatively if the self-hosted instance is unable to be upgraded or re-configured to use the `slack.signing-secret`, the logging configuration can be adjusted to not generate logs from the integration. The default logging configuration can be found in `src/sentry/conf/server.py`. **Services should be restarted once the configuration change is saved.**

x86/fpu: Keep xfd_state in sync with MSR_IA32_XFD

Commit 672365477ae8 (""x86/fpu: Update XFD state where required"") and
commit 8bf26758ca96 (""x86/fpu: Add XFD state to fpstate"") introduced a
per CPU variable xfd_state to keep the MSR_IA32_XFD value cached, in
order to avoid unnecessary writes to the MSR.

On CPU hotplug MSR_IA32_XFD is reset to the init_fpstate.xfd, which
wipes out any stale state. But the per CPU cached xfd value is not
reset, which brings them out of sync.

As a consequence a subsequent xfd_update_state() might fail to update
the MSR which in turn can result in XRSTOR raising a #NM in kernel
space, which crashes the kernel.

To fix this, introduce xfd_set_state() to write xfd_state together
with MSR_IA32_XFD, and use it in all places that set MSR_IA32_XFD.",,

CVE-2024-35175,,,"sshpiper is a reverse proxy for sshd. Starting in version 1.0.50 and prior to version 1.3.0, the way the proxy protocol listener is implemented in sshpiper can allow an attacker to forge their connecting address. Commit 2ddd69876a1e1119059debc59fe869cb4e754430 added the proxy protocol listener as the only listener in sshpiper, with no option to toggle this functionality off. This means that any connection that sshpiper is directly (or in some cases indirectly) exposed to can use proxy protocol to forge its source address. Any users of sshpiper who need logs from it for whitelisting/rate limiting/security investigations could have them become much less useful if an attacker is sending a spoofed source address.

CVE-2024-25129,,,"The CodeQL CLI repo holds binaries for the CodeQL command line interface (CLI). Prior to version 2.16.3, an XML parser used by the CodeQL CLI to read various auxiliary files is vulnerable to an XML External Entity attack. If a vulnerable version of the CLI is used to process either a maliciously modified CodeQL database, or a specially prepared set of QL query sources, the CLI can be made to make an outgoing HTTP request to an URL that contains material read from a local file chosen by the attacker. This may result in a loss of privacy of exfiltration of secrets. Security researchers and QL authors who receive databases or QL source files from untrusted sources may be impacted. A single untrusted `.ql` or `.qll` file cannot be affected, but a zip archive or tarball containing QL sources may unpack auxiliary files that will trigger an attack when CodeQL sees them in the file system. Those using CodeQL for routine analysis of source trees with a preselected set of trusted queries are not affected. In particular, extracting XML files from a source tree into the CodeQL database does not make one vulnerable. The problem is fixed in release 2.16.3 of the CodeQL CLI. Other than upgrading, workarounds include not accepting CodeQL databases or queries from untrusted sources, or only processing such material on a machine without an Internet connection. Customers who use older releases of CodeQL for security scanning in an automated CI system and cannot upgrade for compliance reasons can continue using that version. That use case is safe. If such customers have a private query pack and use the `codeql pack create` command to precompile them before using them in the CI system, they should be using the production CodeQL release to run `codeql pack create`. That command is safe as long as the QL source it precompiled is trusted. All other development of the query pack should use an upgraded CLI.",CWE-611,CWE-611: Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference

CVE-2024-31391,,,"Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File vulnerability in the Apache Solr Operator.

This issue affects all versions of the Apache Solr Operator from 0.3.0 through 0.8.0.

When asked to bootstrap Solr security, the operator will enable basic authentication and create several accounts for accessing Solr: including the ""solr"" and ""admin"" accounts for use by end-users, and a ""k8s-oper"" account which the operator uses for its own requests to Solr.
One common source of these operator requests is healthchecks: liveness, readiness, and startup probes are all used to determine Solr's health and ability to receive traffic.
By default, the operator configures the Solr APIs used for these probes to be exempt from authentication, but users may specifically request that authentication be required on probe endpoints as well.
Whenever one of these probes would fail, if authentication was in use, the Solr Operator would create a Kubernetes ""event"" containing the username and password of the ""k8s-oper"" account.

Within the affected version range, this vulnerability affects any solrcloud resource which (1) bootstrapped security through use of the `.solrOptions.security.authenticationType=basic` option, and (2) required authentication be used on probes by setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=true`.

Users are recommended to upgrade to Solr Operator version 0.8.1, which fixes this issue by ensuring that probes no longer print the credentials used for Solr requests.  Users may also mitigate the vulnerability by disabling authentication on their healthcheck probes using the setting `.solrOptions.security.probesRequireAuth=false`.

Users who grant read and write access to the entire filesystem may not realize that these access to these files may have additional, unintended consequences. The documentation did not reflect that this practice should be undertaken to increase the strength of the security sandbox. Users who run code with `--allow-read` or `--allow-write` may unexpectedly end up granting additional permissions via file-system operations.

As a workaround, it is possible to disable the special pages outside of one's own global wiki by doing something similar to `miraheze/mw-config` commit e5664995fbb8644f9a80b450b4326194f20f9ddc that is adapted to one's own setup.

CVE-2024-34698,,,"FreeScout is a free, self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. Versions of FreeScout prior to 1.8.139 contain a Prototype Pollution vulnerability in the `/public/js/main.js` source file. The Prototype Pollution arises because the `getQueryParam` Function recursively merges an object containing user-controllable properties into an existing object (For URL Query Parameters Parsing), without first sanitizing the keys. This can allow an attacker to inject a property with a key `__proto__`, along with arbitrarily nested properties. The merge operation assigns the nested properties to the `params` object's prototype instead of the target object itself. As a result, the attacker can pollute the prototype with properties containing harmful values, which are then inherited by user-defined objects and subsequently used by the application dangerously. The vulnerability lets an attacker control properties of objects that would otherwise be inaccessible. If the application subsequently handles an attacker-controlled property in an unsafe way, this can potentially be chained with other vulnerabilities like DOM-based XSS, Open Redirection, Cookie Manipulation, Link Manipulation, HTML Injection, etc. Version 1.8.139 contains a patch for the issue.",CWE-1321,CWE-1321: Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution')

CVE-2024-24576,,,"Rust is a programming language. The Rust Security Response WG was notified that the Rust standard library prior to version 1.77.2 did not properly escape arguments when invoking batch files (with the `bat` and `cmd` extensions) on Windows using the `Command`. An attacker able to control the arguments passed to the spawned process could execute arbitrary shell commands by bypassing the escaping. The severity of this vulnerability is critical for those who invoke batch files on Windows with untrusted arguments. No other platform or use is affected.

The `Command::arg` and `Command::args` APIs state in their documentation that the arguments will be passed to the spawned process as-is, regardless of the content of the arguments, and will not be evaluated by a shell. This means it should be safe to pass untrusted input as an argument.

On Windows, the implementation of this is more complex than other platforms, because the Windows API only provides a single string containing all the arguments to the spawned process, and it's up to the spawned process to split them. Most programs use the standard C run-time argv, which in practice results in a mostly consistent way arguments are splitted.

One exception though is `cmd.exe` (used among other things to execute batch files), which has its own argument splitting logic. That forces the standard library to implement custom escaping for arguments passed to batch files. Unfortunately it was reported that our escaping logic was not thorough enough, and it was possible to pass malicious arguments that would result in arbitrary shell execution.

Due to the complexity of `cmd.exe`, we didn't identify a solution that would correctly escape arguments in all cases. To maintain our API guarantees, we improved the robustness of the escaping code, and changed the `Command` API to return an `InvalidInput` error when it cannot safely escape an argument. This error will be emitted when spawning the process.

The fix is included in Rust 1.77.2. Note that the new escaping logic for batch files errs on the conservative side, and could reject valid arguments. Those who implement the escaping themselves or only handle trusted inputs on Windows can also use the `CommandExt::raw_arg` method to bypass the standard library's escaping logic.

CVE-2024-37891,,," urllib3 is a user-friendly HTTP client library for Python. When using urllib3's proxy support with `ProxyManager`, the `Proxy-Authorization` header is only sent to the configured proxy, as expected. However, when sending HTTP requests *without* using urllib3's proxy support, it's possible to accidentally configure the `Proxy-Authorization` header even though it won't have any effect as the request is not using a forwarding proxy or a tunneling proxy. In those cases, urllib3 doesn't treat the `Proxy-Authorization` HTTP header as one carrying authentication material and thus doesn't strip the header on cross-origin redirects. Because this is a highly unlikely scenario, we believe the severity of this vulnerability is low for almost all users. Out of an abundance of caution urllib3 will automatically strip the `Proxy-Authorization` header during cross-origin redirects to avoid the small chance that users are doing this on accident. Users should use urllib3's proxy support or disable automatic redirects to achieve safe processing of the `Proxy-Authorization` header, but we still decided to strip the header by default in order to further protect users who aren't using the correct approach. We believe the number of usages affected by this advisory is low. It requires all of the following to be true to be exploited: 1. Setting the `Proxy-Authorization` header without using urllib3's built-in proxy support. 2. Not disabling HTTP redirects. 3. Either not using an HTTPS origin server or for the proxy or target origin to redirect to a malicious origin. Users are advised to update to either version 1.26.19 or version 2.2.2. Users unable to upgrade may use the `Proxy-Authorization` header with urllib3's `ProxyManager`, disable HTTP redirects using `redirects=False` when sending requests, or not user the `Proxy-Authorization` header as mitigations.",CWE-669,CWE-669: Incorrect Resource Transfer Between Spheres

CVE-2024-37293,,,"The AWS Deployment Framework (ADF) is a framework to manage and deploy resources across multiple AWS accounts and regions within an AWS Organization. ADF allows for staged, parallel, multi-account, cross-region deployments of applications or resources via the structure defined in AWS Organizations while taking advantage of services such as AWS CodePipeline, AWS CodeBuild, and AWS CodeCommit to alleviate the heavy lifting and management compared to a traditional CI/CD setup. ADF contains a bootstrap process that is responsible to deploy ADF's bootstrap stacks to facilitate multi-account cross-region deployments. The ADF bootstrap process relies on elevated privileges to perform this task. Two versions of the bootstrap process exist; a code-change driven pipeline using AWS CodeBuild and an event-driven state machine using AWS Lambda. If an actor has permissions to change the behavior of the CodeBuild project or the Lambda function, they would be able to escalate their privileges.

Prior to version 4.0.0, the bootstrap CodeBuild role provides access to the `sts:AssumeRole` operation without further restrictions. Therefore, it is able to assume into any AWS Account in the AWS Organization with the elevated privileges provided by the cross-account access role. By default, this role is not restricted when it is created by AWS Organizations, providing Administrator level access to the AWS resources in the AWS Account. The patches for this issue are included in `aws-deployment-framework` version 4.0.0.

As a temporary mitigation, add a permissions boundary to the roles created by ADF in the management account. The permissions boundary should deny all IAM and STS actions. This permissions boundary should be in place until you upgrade ADF or bootstrap a new account. While the permissions boundary is in place, the account management and bootstrapping of accounts are unable to create, update, or assume into roles. This mitigates the privilege escalation risk, but also disables ADF's ability to create, manage, and bootstrap accounts.",CWE-266,CWE-266: Incorrect Privilege Assignment

By doing this, the attacker may be able to probe the network that the CVAT backend runs in for HTTP(S) servers. In addition, if there is a web server on this network that is sufficiently API-compatible with an Amazon S3 or Azure Blob Storage endpoint, and either allows anonymous access, or allows authentication with credentials that are known by the attacker, then the attacker may be able to create a cloud storage linked to this server. They may then be able to list files on the server; extract files from the server, if these files are of a type that CVAT supports reading from cloud storage (media data (such as images/videos/archives), importable annotations or datasets, task/project backups); and/or overwrite files on this server with exported annotations/datasets/backups. The exact capabilities of the attacker will depend on how the internal server is configured. Users should upgrade to CVAT 2.14.3 to receive a patch. In this release, the existing SSRF mitigation measures are applied to requests to cloud providers, with access to intranet IP addresses prohibited by default. Some workarounds are also available.

usb: gadget: ncm: Avoid dropping datagrams of properly parsed NTBs

It is observed sometimes when tethering is used over NCM with Windows 11
as host, at some instances, the gadget_giveback has one byte appended at
the end of a proper NTB. When the NTB is parsed, unwrap call looks for
any leftover bytes in SKB provided by u_ether and if there are any pending
bytes, it treats them as a separate NTB and parses it. But in case the
second NTB (as per unwrap call) is faulty/corrupt, all the datagrams that
were parsed properly in the first NTB and saved in rx_list are dropped.

Adding a few custom traces showed the following:
[002] d..1  7828.532866: dwc3_gadget_giveback: ep1out:
req 000000003868811a length 1025/16384 zsI ==> 0
[002] d..1  7828.532867: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb toprocess: 1025
[002] d..1  7828.532867: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb nth: 1751999342
[002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb seq: 0xce67
[002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb blk_len: 0x400
[002] d..1  7828.532868: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb ndp_len: 0x10
[002] d..1  7828.532869: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: Parsed NTB with 1 frames

In this case, the giveback is of 1025 bytes and block length is 1024.
The rest 1 byte (which is 0x00) won't be parsed resulting in drop of
all datagrams in rx_list.

Same is case with packets of size 2048:
[002] d..1  7828.557948: dwc3_gadget_giveback: ep1out:
req 0000000011dfd96e length 2049/16384 zsI ==> 0
[002] d..1  7828.557949: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb nth: 1751999342
[002] d..1  7828.557950: ncm_unwrap_ntb: K: ncm_unwrap_ntb blk_len: 0x800

Lecroy shows one byte coming in extra confirming that the byte is coming
in from PC:

 Transfer 2959 - Bytes Transferred(1025)  Timestamp((18.524 843 590)
 - Transaction 8391 - Data(1025 bytes) Timestamp(18.524 843 590)

       Data(1 byte)
       Duration(66.160ns) Time(282.000ns) Timestamp(18.524 845 722)

According to Windows driver, no ZLP is needed if wBlockLength is non-zero,
because the non-zero wBlockLength has already told the function side the
size of transfer to be expected. However, there are in-market NCM devices
that rely on ZLP as long as the wBlockLength is multiple of wMaxPacketSize.
To deal with such devices, it pads an extra 0 at end so the transfer is no
longer multiple of wMaxPacketSize.",,

Bluetooth: L2CAP: Fix slab-use-after-free in l2cap_connect()

Extend a critical section to prevent chan from early freeing.
Also make the l2cap_connect() return type void. Nothing is using the
returned value but it is ugly to return a potentially freed pointer.
Making it void will help with backports because earlier kernels did use
the return value. Now the compile will break for kernels where this
patch is not a complete fix.

At the time of LPAR boot up, partition firmware provides Open Firmware
property ibm,dma-window for the PE. This property is provided on the PCI
bus the PE is attached to.

There are execptions where the partition firmware might not provide this
property for the PE at the time of LPAR boot up. One of the scenario is
where the firmware has frozen the PE due to some error condition. This
PE is frozen for 24 hours or unless the whole system is reinitialized.

Within this time frame, if the LPAR is booted, the frozen PE will be
presented to the LPAR but ibm,dma-window property could be missing.

dereference, when configuring the PCI bus the PE is attached to.

CVE-2024-36115,,,"Reposilite is an open source, lightweight and easy-to-use repository manager for Maven based artifacts in JVM ecosystem. As a Maven repository manager, Reposilite provides the ability to view the artifacts content in the browser, as well as perform administrative tasks via API. The problem lies in the fact that the artifact's content is served via the same origin (protocol/host/port) as the Admin UI. If the artifact contains HTML content with javascript inside, the javascript is executed within the same origin. Therefore, if an authenticated user is viewing the artifacts content, the javascript inside can access the browser's local storage where the user's password (aka 'token-secret') is stored. It is especially dangerous in scenarios where Reposilite is configured to mirror third party repositories, like the Maven Central Repository. Since anyone can publish an artifact to Maven Central under its own name, such malicious packages can be used to attack the Reposilite instance. This issue may lead to the full Reposilite instance compromise. If this attack is performed against the admin user, it's possible to use the admin API to modify settings and artifacts on the instance. In the worst case scenario, an attacker would be able to obtain the Remote code execution on all systems that use artifacts from Reposilite. It's important to note that the attacker does not need to lure a victim user to use a malicious artifact, but just open a link in the browser. This link can be silently loaded among the other HTML content, making this attack unnoticeable. Even if the Reposilite instance is located in an isolated environment, such as behind a VPN or in the local network, this attack is still possible as it can be performed from the admin browser. Reposilite has addressed this issue in version 3.5.12. Users are advised to upgrade. There are no known workarounds for this vulnerability.

CVE-2024-36894,CWE-362,CWE-362 Concurrent Execution using Shared Resource with Improper Synchronization ('Race Condition'),"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

usb: gadget: f_fs: Fix race between aio_cancel() and AIO request complete

FFS based applications can utilize the aio_cancel() callback to dequeue
pending USB requests submitted to the UDC.  There is a scenario where the
FFS application issues an AIO cancel call, while the UDC is handling a
soft disconnect.  For a DWC3 based implementation, the callstack looks
like the following:

    DWC3 Gadget                               FFS Application
dwc3_gadget_soft_disconnect()              ...
  --> dwc3_stop_active_transfers()
    --> dwc3_gadget_giveback(-ESHUTDOWN)
      --> ffs_epfile_async_io_complete()   ffs_aio_cancel()
        --> usb_ep_free_request()            --> usb_ep_dequeue()

There is currently no locking implemented between the AIO completion
handler and AIO cancel, so the issue occurs if the completion routine is
running in parallel to an AIO cancel call coming from the FFS application.
As the completion call frees the USB request (io_data->req) the FFS
application is also referencing it for the usb_ep_dequeue() call.  This can
lead to accessing a stale/hanging pointer.

commit b566d38857fc (""usb: gadget: f_fs: use io_data->status consistently"")
relocated the usb_ep_free_request() into ffs_epfile_async_io_complete().
However, in order to properly implement locking to mitigate this issue, the
spinlock can't be added to ffs_epfile_async_io_complete(), as
usb_ep_dequeue() (if successfully dequeuing a USB request) will call the
function driver's completion handler in the same context.  Hence, leading
into a deadlock.

Fix this issue by moving the usb_ep_free_request() back to
ffs_user_copy_worker(), and ensuring that it explicitly sets io_data->req
to NULL after freeing it within the ffs->eps_lock.  This resolves the race
condition above, as the ffs_aio_cancel() routine will not continue
attempting to dequeue a request that has already been freed, or the
ffs_user_copy_work() not freeing the USB request until the AIO cancel is
done referencing it.

This fix depends on
  commit b566d38857fc (""usb: gadget: f_fs: use io_data->status
  consistently"")",,

af_unix: Update unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb under sk_receive_queue lock.

Billy Jheng Bing-Jhong reported a race between __unix_gc() and
queue_oob().

__unix_gc() tries to garbage-collect close()d inflight sockets,
and then if the socket has MSG_OOB in unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb, GC
will drop the reference and set NULL to it locklessly.

However, the peer socket still can send MSG_OOB message and
queue_oob() can update unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb concurrently, leading
NULL pointer dereference. [0]

To fix the issue, let's update unix_sk(sk)->oob_skb under the
sk_receive_queue's lock and take it everywhere we touch oob_skb.

Note that we defer kfree_skb() in manage_oob() to silence lockdep
false-positive (See [1]).

CVE-2024-36905,CWE-369,CWE-369 Divide By Zero,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: defer shutdown(SEND_SHUTDOWN) for TCP_SYN_RECV sockets

TCP_SYN_RECV state is really special, it is only used by
cross-syn connections, mostly used by fuzzers.

In the following crash [1], syzbot managed to trigger a divide
by zero in tcp_rcv_space_adjust()

A socket makes the following state transitions,
without ever calling tcp_init_transfer(),
meaning tcp_init_buffer_space() is also not called.

         TCP_CLOSE
connect()
         TCP_SYN_SENT
         TCP_SYN_RECV
shutdown() -> tcp_shutdown(sk, SEND_SHUTDOWN)
         TCP_FIN_WAIT1

To fix this issue, change tcp_shutdown() to not
perform a TCP_SYN_RECV -> TCP_FIN_WAIT1 transition,
which makes no sense anyway.

When tcp_rcv_state_process() later changes socket state
from TCP_SYN_RECV to TCP_ESTABLISH, then look at
sk->sk_shutdown to finally enter TCP_FIN_WAIT1 state,
and send a FIN packet from a sane socket state.

This means tcp_send_fin() can now be called from BH
context, and must use GFP_ATOMIC allocations.

the pool, skip the assignment.

tj: This doesn't fully fix the bug as CPUs can still go down between picking
the target CPU and the wake call. Fixing that likely requires adding
cpu_online() test to either the sched or s390 arch code. However, regardless
of how that is fixed, workqueue shouldn't be picking a CPU which isn't

mm: swap: fix race between free_swap_and_cache() and swapoff()

There was previously a theoretical window where swapoff() could run and
teardown a swap_info_struct while a call to free_swap_and_cache() was
running in another thread.  This could cause, amongst other bad
possibilities, swap_page_trans_huge_swapped() (called by
free_swap_and_cache()) to access the freed memory for swap_map.

This is a theoretical problem and I haven't been able to provoke it from a
test case.  But there has been agreement based on code review that this is
possible (see link below).

Fix it by using get_swap_device()/put_swap_device(), which will stall
swapoff().  There was an extra check in _swap_info_get() to confirm that
the swap entry was not free.  This isn't present in get_swap_device()
because it doesn't make sense in general due to the race between getting
the reference and swapoff.  So I've added an equivalent check directly in
free_swap_and_cache().

Details of how to provoke one possible issue (thanks to David Hildenbrand
for deriving this):

--8<-----

__swap_entry_free() might be the last user and result in
""count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE"".

swapoff->try_to_unuse() will stop as soon as soon as si->inuse_pages==0.

So the question is: could someone reclaim the folio and turn
si->inuse_pages==0, before we completed swap_page_trans_huge_swapped().

Imagine the following: 2 MiB folio in the swapcache. Only 2 subpages are
still references by swap entries.

Process 1 still references subpage 0 via swap entry.
Process 2 still references subpage 1 via swap entry.

Process 1 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().
-> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE
[then, preempted in the hypervisor etc.]

Process 2 quits. Calls free_swap_and_cache().
-> count == SWAP_HAS_CACHE

Process 2 goes ahead, passes swap_page_trans_huge_swapped(), and calls
__try_to_reclaim_swap().

__try_to_reclaim_swap()->folio_free_swap()->delete_from_swap_cache()->
put_swap_folio()->free_swap_slot()->swapcache_free_entries()->
swap_entry_free()->swap_range_free()->
...
WRITE_ONCE(si->inuse_pages, si->inuse_pages - nr_entries);

What stops swapoff to succeed after process 2 reclaimed the swap cache
but before process1 finished its call to swap_page_trans_huge_swapped()?

KVM: Always flush async #PF workqueue when vCPU is being destroyed

Always flush the per-vCPU async #PF workqueue when a vCPU is clearing its
completion queue, e.g. when a VM and all its vCPUs is being destroyed.
KVM must ensure that none of its workqueue callbacks is running when the
last reference to the KVM _module_ is put.  Gifting a reference to the
associated VM prevents the workqueue callback from dereferencing freed
vCPU/VM memory, but does not prevent the KVM module from being unloaded
before the callback completes.

Drop the misguided VM refcount gifting, as calling kvm_put_kvm() from
async_pf_execute() if kvm_put_kvm() flushes the async #PF workqueue will
result in deadlock.  async_pf_execute() can't return until kvm_put_kvm()
finishes, and kvm_put_kvm() can't return until async_pf_execute() finishes:

If kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue() actually flushes the workqueue,
then there's no need to gift async_pf_execute() a reference because all
invocations of async_pf_execute() will be forced to complete before the
vCPU and its VM are destroyed/freed.  And that in turn fixes the module
unloading bug as __fput() won't do module_put() on the last vCPU reference
until the vCPU has been freed, e.g. if closing the vCPU file also puts the
last reference to the KVM module.

Note that kvm_check_async_pf_completion() may also take the work item off
the completion queue and so also needs to flush the work queue, as the
work will not be seen by kvm_clear_async_pf_completion_queue().  Waiting
on the workqueue could theoretically delay a vCPU due to waiting for the
work to complete, but that's a very, very small chance, and likely a very
small delay.  kvm_arch_async_page_present_queued() unconditionally makes a
new request, i.e. will effectively delay entering the guest, so the
remaining work is really just:

        trace_kvm_async_pf_completed(addr, cr2_or_gpa);

        __kvm_vcpu_wake_up(vcpu);

        mmput(mm);

and mmput() can't drop the last reference to the page tables if the vCPU is
still alive, i.e. the vCPU won't get stuck tearing down page tables.

Add a helper to do the flushing, specifically to deal with ""wakeup all""
work items, as they aren't actually work items, i.e. are never placed in a
workqueue.  Trying to flush a bogus workqueue entry rightly makes
__flush_work() complain (kudos to whoever added that sanity check).

Note, commit 5f6de5cbebee (""KVM: Prevent module exit until al

CVE-2024-26864,CWE-200,CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

tcp: Fix refcnt handling in __inet_hash_connect().

syzbot reported a warning in sk_nulls_del_node_init_rcu().

The commit 66b60b0c8c4a (""dccp/tcp: Unhash sk from ehash for tb2 alloc
failure after check_estalblished()."") tried to fix an issue that an
unconnected socket occupies an ehash entry when bhash2 allocation fails.

In such a case, we need to revert changes done by check_established(),
which does not hold refcnt when inserting socket into ehash.

So, to revert the change, we need to __sk_nulls_add_node_rcu() instead
of sk_nulls_add_node_rcu().

Otherwise, sock_put() will cause refcnt underflow and leak the socket.

Adding any sort of useful debug usually makes it go away, so I hand
wrote the function in a line, and debugged the asm.

Every so often pt->memory->ptrs is NULL. This ptrs ptr is set in
the nv50_instobj_acquire called from nvkm_kmap.

If Thread A and Thread B both get to nv50_instobj_acquire around
the same time, and Thread A hits the refcount_set line, and in
lockstep thread B succeeds at refcount_inc_not_zero, there is a
chance the ptrs value won't have been stored since refcount_set
is unordered. Force a memory barrier here, I picked smp_mb, since
we want it on all CPUs and it's write followed by a read.

netfilter: nft_set_pipapo: do not free live element

Pablo reports a crash with large batches of elements with a
back-to-back add/remove pattern.  Quoting Pablo:

  add_elem(""00000000"") timeout 100 ms
  ...
  add_elem(""0000000X"") timeout 100 ms
  del_elem(""0000000X"") <---------------- delete one that was just added
  ...
  add_elem(""00005000"") timeout 100 ms

  1) nft_pipapo_remove() removes element 0000000X
  Then, KASAN shows a splat.

Looking at the remove function there is a chance that we will drop a
rule that maps to a non-deactivated element.

Removal happens in two steps, first we do a lookup for key k and return the
to-be-removed element and mark it as inactive in the next generation.
Then, in a second step, the element gets removed from the set/map.

The _remove function does not work correctly if we have more than one
element that share the same key.

This can happen if we insert an element into a set when the set already
holds an element with same key, but the element mapping to the existing
key has timed out or is not active in the next generation.

In such case its possible that removal will unmap the wrong element.
If this happens, we will leak the non-deactivated element, it becomes
unreachable.

The element that got deactivated (and will be freed later) will
remain reachable in the set data structure, this can result in
a crash when such an element is retrieved during lookup (stale
pointer).

Add a check that the fully matching key does in fact map to the element
that we have marked as inactive in the deactivation step.
If not, we need to continue searching.

Add a bug/warn trap at the end of the function as well, the remove
function must not ever be called with an invisible/unreachable/non-existent
element.

That has been tracked down to be happening when another thread is
deactivating the VMA inside __active_retire() helper, after the VMA's
active counter has been already decremented to 0, but before deactivation
of the VMA's object is reported to the object debugging tool.

We could prevent from that race by serializing i915_active_fini() with
__active_retire() via ref->tree_lock, but that wouldn't stop the VMA from
being used, e.g. from __i915_vma_retire() called at the end of
__active_retire(), after that VMA has been already freed by a concurrent
i915_vma_destroy() on return from the i915_active_fini().  Then, we should
rather fix the issue at the VMA level, not in i915_active.

Since __i915_vma_parked() is called from __gt_park() on last put of the
GT's wakeref, the issue could be addressed by holding the GT wakeref long
enough for __active_retire() to complete before that wakeref is released
and the GT parked.

I believe the issue was introduced by commit d93939730347 (""drm/i915:
Remove the vma refcount"") which moved a call to i915_active_fini() from
a dropped i915_vma_release(), called on last put of the removed VMA kref,
to i915_vma_parked() processing path called on last put of a GT wakeref.
However, its visibility to the object debugging tool was suppressed by a
bug in i915_active that was fixed two weeks later with commit e92eb246feb9
(""drm/i915/active: Fix missing debug object activation"").

A VMA associated with a request doesn't acquire a GT wakeref by itself.
Instead, it depends on a wakeref held directly by the request's active
intel_context for a GT associated with its VM, and indirectly on that
intel_context's engine wakeref if the engine belongs to the same GT as the
VMA's VM.  Those wakerefs are released asynchronously to VMA deactivation.

Fix the issue by getting a wakeref for the VMA's GT when activating it,
and putting that wakeref only after the VMA is deactivated.  However,
exclude global GTT from that processing path, otherwise the GPU never goes
idle.  Since __i915_vma_retire() may be called from atomic contexts, use
async variant of wakeref put.  Also, to avoid circular locking dependency,
take care of acquiring the wakeref before VM mutex when both are needed.

v7: Add inline comments with justifications for:
    - using untracked variants of intel_gt_pm_get/put() (Nirmoy),
    - using async variant of _put(),
    - not getting the wakeref in case of a global GTT,
    - always getting the first wakeref outside vm->mutex.
v6: Since __i915_vma_active/retire() callbacks are not serialized, storing
    a wakeref tracking handle inside struct i915_vma is not safe, and
    there is no other good place for that.  Use untracked variants of
    intel_gt_pm_get/put_async().
v5: Replace ""tile"" with ""GT"" across commit description (Rodrigo),

Prior to versions 2.45.1, 2.44.1, 2.43.4, 2.42.2, 2.41.1, 2.40.2, and 2.39.4, local clones may end up hardlinking files into the target repository's object database when source and target repository reside on the same disk. If the source repository is owned by a different user, then those hardlinked files may be rewritten at any point in time by the untrusted user. Cloning local repositories will cause Git to either copy or hardlink files of the source repository into the target repository. This significantly speeds up such local clones compared to doing a ""proper"" clone and saves both disk space and compute time. When cloning a repository located on the same disk that is owned by a different user than the current user we also end up creating such hardlinks. These files will continue to be owned and controlled by the potentially-untrusted user and can be rewritten by them at will in the future.

During internal penetration testing of a product based on Yii2, users discovered a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the framework itself. This issue is relevant for the latest version of Yii2 (2.0.49.3). This issue lies in the mechanism for displaying function argument values in the stack trace. The vulnerability manifests when an argument's value exceeds 32 characters. For convenience, argument values exceeding this limit are truncated and displayed with an added ""..."". The full argument value becomes visible when hovering over it with the mouse, as it is displayed in the title attribute of a span tag.

CVE-2024-32876,,,"NewPipe is an Android app for video streaming written in Java. It supports exporting and importing backups, as a way to let users move their data to a new device effortlessly. However, in versions 0.13.4 through 0.26.1, importing a backup file from an untrusted source could have resulted in Arbitrary Code Execution. This is because backups are serialized/deserialized using Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol, which can allow constructing any class in the app, unless properly restricted.

To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to build a backup file containing the exploit, and then persuade a user into importing it. During the import process, the malicious code would be executed, possibly crashing the app, stealing user data from the NewPipe app, performing nasty actions through Android APIs, and attempting Android JVM/Sandbox escapes through vulnerabilities in the Android OS.

The attack can take place only if the user imports a malicious backup file, so an attacker would need to trick a user into importing a backup file from a source they can control. The implementation details of the malicious backup file can be independent of the attacked user or the device they are being run on, and do not require additional privileges.

All NewPipe versions from 0.13.4 to 0.26.1 are vulnerable. NewPipe version 0.27.0 fixes the issue by doing the following: Restrict the classes that can be deserialized when calling Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol, by adding a whitelist with only innocuous data-only classes that can't lead to Arbitrary Code Execution; deprecate backups serialized with Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol; use JSON serialization for all newly created backups (but still include an alternative file serialized with Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol in the backup zip for backwards compatibility); show a warning to the user when attempting to import a backup where the only available serialization mode is Java's Object Serialization Stream Protocol (note that in the future this serialization mode will be removed completely).

As a separate feature, it also provides the ability to monitor the performance of Kafka brokers by connecting to their JMX ports. JMX is based on the RMI protocol, so it is inherently susceptible to deserialization attacks. A potential attacker can exploit this feature by connecting Kafka UI backend to its own malicious broker.

Normally, the `--command` argument of `flatpak run` expects to be given a command to run in the specified Flatpak app, optionally along with some arguments. However it is possible to instead pass `bwrap` arguments to `--command=`, such as `--bind`. It's possible to pass an arbitrary `commandline` to the portal interface `org.freedesktop.portal.Background.RequestBackground` from within a Flatpak app. When this is converted into a `--command` and arguments, it achieves the same effect of passing arguments directly to `bwrap`, and thus can be used for a sandbox escape. The solution is to pass the `--` argument to `bwrap`, which makes it stop processing options. This has been supported since bubblewrap 0.3.0. All supported versions of Flatpak require at least that version of bubblewrap. xdg-desktop-portal version 1.18.4 will mitigate this vulnerability by only allowing Flatpak apps to create .desktop files for commands that do not start with --.

CVE-2024-32970,,,"Phlex is a framework for building object-oriented views in Ruby. In affected versions there is a potential cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability that can be exploited via maliciously crafted user data. Since the last two vulnerabilities https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-242p-4v39-2v8g and https://github.com/phlex-ruby/phlex/security/advisories/GHSA-g7xq-xv8c-h98c, we have invested in extensive browser tests. It was these new tests that helped us uncover these issues. As of now the project exercises every possible attack vector the developers can think of — including enumerating every ASCII character, and we run these tests in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. Additionally, we test against a list of 6613 known XSS payloads (see: payloadbox/xss-payload-list). The reason these issues were not detected before is the escapes were working as designed. However, their design didn't take into account just how recklessly permissive browsers are when it comes to executing unsafe JavaScript via HTML attributes. If you render an `<a>` tag with an `href` attribute set to a user-provided link, that link could potentially execute JavaScript when clicked by another user. If you splat user-provided attributes when rendering any HTML or SVG tag, malicious event attributes could be included in the output, executing JavaScript when the events are triggered by another user.

Starting in version 0.3.8 and prior to version 0.4.0b1, when looping over a `range` of the form `range(start, start + N)`, if `start` is negative, the execution will always revert. This issue is caused by an incorrect assertion inserted by the code generation of the range `stmt.parse_For_range()`. The issue arises when `start` is signed, instead of using `sle`, `le` is used and `start` is interpreted as an unsigned integer for the comparison. If it is a negative number, its 255th bit is set to `1` and is hence interpreted as a very large unsigned integer making the assertion always fail. Any contract having a `range(start, start + N)` where `start` is a signed integer with the possibility for `start` to be negative is affected. If a call goes through the loop while supplying a negative `start` the execution will revert. Version 0.4.0b1 fixes the issue.",CWE-681,CWE-681: Incorrect Conversion between Numeric Types

CVE-2024-32003,,,"wn-dusk-plugin (Dusk plugin) is a plugin which integrates Laravel Dusk browser testing into Winter CMS. The Dusk plugin provides some special routes as part of its testing framework to allow a browser environment (such as headless Chrome) to act as a user in the Backend or User plugin without having to go through authentication. This route is `[[URL]]/_dusk/login/[[USER ID]]/[[MANAGER]]` - where `[[URL]]` is the base URL of the site, `[[USER ID]]` is the ID of the user account and `[[MANAGER]]` is the authentication manager (either `backend` for Backend, or `user` for the User plugin). If a configuration of a site using the Dusk plugin is set up in such a way that the Dusk plugin is available publicly and the test cases in Dusk are run with live data, this route may potentially be used to gain access to any user account in either the Backend or User plugin without authentication. As indicated in the `README`, this plugin should only be used in development and should *NOT* be used in a production instance. It is specifically recommended that the plugin be installed as a development dependency only in Composer. In order to remediate this issue, the special routes used above will now no longer be registered unless the `APP_ENV` environment variable is specifically set to `dusk`. Since Winter by default does not use this environment variable and it is not populated by default, it will only exist if Dusk's automatic configuration is used (which won't exhibit this vulnerability) or if a developer manually specifies it in their configuration. The automatic configuration performed by the Dusk plugin has also been hardened by default to use sane defaults and not allow external environment variables to leak into this configuration. This will only affect users in which the Winter CMS installation meets ALL the following criteria: 1. The Dusk plugin is installed in the Winter CMS instance. 2. The application is in production mode (ie. the `debug` config value is set to `true` in `config/app.php`). 3. The Dusk plugin's automatic configuration has been overridden, either by providing a custom `.env.dusk` file or by providing custom configuration in the `config/dusk` folder, or by providing configuration environment variables externally. 4. The environment has been configured to use production data in the database for testing, and not the temporary SQLite database that Dusk uses by default. 5. The application is connectable via the web. This issue has been fixed in version 2.1.0. Users are advised to upgrade.",CWE-269,CWE-269: Improper Privilege Management

Prior to 17.0.0, there is a way to mint arbitrary tokens due to the possibility to have two different states not in sync during the execution of a transaction. The exploit is based on the fact that to sync the Cosmos SDK state and the EVM one, we rely on the `stateDB.Commit()` method. When we call this method, we iterate though all the `dirtyStorage` and, **if and only if** it is different than the `originStorage`, we set the new state. Setting the new state means we update the Cosmos SDK KVStore.  If a contract storage state that is the same before and after a transaction, but is changed during the transaction and can call an external contract after the change, it can be exploited to make the transaction similar to non-atomic. The vulnerability is **critical** since this could lead to drain of funds through creative SC interactions.

CVE-2024-32018,,,"RIOT is a real-time multi-threading operating system that supports a range of devices that are typically 8-bit, 16-bit and 32-bit microcontrollers. Most codebases define assertion macros which compile to a no-op on non-debug builds. If assertions are the only line of defense against untrusted input, the software may be exposed to attacks that leverage the lack of proper input checks. In detail, in the `nimble_scanlist_update()` function below, `len` is checked in an assertion and subsequently used in a call to `memcpy()`. If an attacker is able to provide a larger `len` value while assertions are compiled-out, they can write past the end of the fixed-length `e->ad` buffer. If the unchecked input above is attacker-controlled and crosses a security boundary, the impact of the buffer overflow vulnerability could range from denial of service to arbitrary code execution. This issue has not yet been patched. Users are advised to add manual `len` checking.",CWE-120,CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input ('Classic Buffer Overflow')

clk: bcm: dvp: Assign ->num before accessing ->hws

Commit f316cdff8d67 (""clk: Annotate struct clk_hw_onecell_data with

with __counted_by, which informs the bounds sanitizer about the number
of elements in hws, so that it can warn when hws is accessed out of
bounds. As noted in that change, the __counted_by member must be
initialized with the number of elements before the first array access
happens, otherwise there will be a warning from each access prior to the
initialization because the number of elements is zero. This occurs in
clk_dvp_probe() due to ->num being assigned after ->hws has been

It was discovered recently that when we deallocate a node, in some cases only the first memory chunk is deallocated, and the rest of the memory chunks remain (incorrectly) allocated, causing a memory leak. In the worst case, depending on how a canister uses the BTreeMap, an adversary could interact with the canister through its API and trigger interactions with the map that keep consuming memory due to the memory leak. This could potentially lead to using an excessive amount of memory, or even running out of memory.

This issue has been fixed in  #212 https://github.com/dfinity/stable-structures/pull/212  by changing the logic for deallocating nodes to ensure that all of a node's memory chunks are deallocated and users are asked to upgrade to version 0.6.4..

CVE-2024-29210,CWE-269,CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management,"A local privilege escalation (LPE) vulnerability has been identified in Phish Alert Button for Outlook (PAB), specifically within its configuration management functionalities. This vulnerability allows a regular user to modify the application's configuration file to redirect update checks to an arbitrary server, which can then be exploited in conjunction with CVE-2024-29209 to execute arbitrary code with elevated privileges.

The issue stems from improper permission settings on the application's configuration file, which is stored in a common directory accessible to all users. This file includes critical parameters, such as the update server URL. By default, the application does not enforce adequate access controls on this file, allowing non-privileged users to modify it without administrative consent.

An attacker with regular user access can alter the update server URL specified in the configuration file to point to a malicious server. When the application performs its next update check, it will contact the attacker-controlled server. If the system is also vulnerable to CVE-2024-29209, the attacker can deliver a malicious update package that, when executed, grants them elevated privileges.

Impact:
This vulnerability can lead to a regular user executing code with administrative privileges. This can result in unauthorized access to sensitive data, installation of additional malware, and a full takeover of the affected system.

Affected Products:
Phish Alert Button (PAB) for Outlook versions 1.10.0-1.10.11
Second Chance Client versions 2.0.0-2.0.9
PIQ Client versions 1.0.0-1.0.15

Remediation:
KnowBe4 has released a patch that corrects the permission settings on the configuration file to prevent unauthorized modifications. Automated updates will be pushed to address this issue. Users of affected versions should verify the latest version is applied and, if not, apply the latest updates provided by KnowBe4.

Workarounds:
Manually set the correct permissions on the configuration file to restrict write access to administrators only.

Credits:
This vulnerability was discovered by Ceri Coburn at Pen Test Partners, who reported it responsibly to the vendor.

CVE-2024-29902,,,"Cosign provides code signing and transparency for containers and binaries. Prior to version 2.2.4, a remote image with a malicious attachment can cause denial of service of the host machine running Cosign. This can impact other services on the machine that rely on having memory available such as a Redis database which can result in data loss. It can also impact the availability of other services on the machine that will not be available for the duration of the machine denial. The root cause of this issue is that Cosign reads the attachment from a remote image entirely into memory without checking the size of the attachment first. As such, a large attachment can make Cosign read a large attachment into memory; If the attachments size is larger than the machine has memory available, the machine will be denied of service. The Go runtime will make a SigKill after a few seconds of system-wide denial. This issue can allow a supply-chain escalation from a compromised registry to the Cosign user: If an attacher has compromised a registry or the account of an image vendor, they can include a malicious attachment and hurt the image consumer.

CVE-2024-29184,,,"FreeScout is a self-hosted help desk and shared mailbox. A Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified within the Signature Input Field of the FreeScout Application prior to version 1.8.128. Stored XSS occurs when user input is not properly sanitized and is stored on the server, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that will be executed when other users access the affected page. In this case, the Support Agent User can inject malicious scripts into their signature, which will then be executed when viewed by the Administrator.

The application protects users against XSS attacks by enforcing a CSP policy, the CSP Policy is:  `script-src 'self' 'nonce-abcd'  `. The CSP policy only allows the inclusion of JS files that are present on the application server and doesn't allow any inline script or script other than nonce-abcd. The CSP policy was bypassed by uploading a JS file to the server by a POST request to /conversation/upload endpoint. After this, a working XSS payload was crafted by including the uploaded JS file link as the src of the script. This bypassed the CSP policy and XSS attacks became possible.

The impact of this vulnerability is severe as it allows an attacker to compromise the FreeScout Application. By exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker can perform various malicious actions such as forcing the Administrator to execute actions without their knowledge or consent. For instance, the attacker can force the Administrator to add a new administrator controlled by the attacker, thereby giving the attacker full control over the application. Alternatively, the attacker can elevate the privileges of a low-privileged user to Administrator, further compromising the security of the application. Attackers can steal sensitive information such as login credentials, session tokens, personal identifiable information (PII), and financial data. The vulnerability can also lead to defacement of the Application.

This is done by retirement of old IDs, the endpoint sends NEW_CONNECTION_ID includes a value in the retire_prior_to field, which elicits a RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frame as confirmation. An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending NEW_CONNECTION_ID frames and manipulating the connection (e.g. by restricting the peer's congestion window size) so that RETIRE_CONNECTION_ID frames can only be sent at a slower rate than they are received, leading to storage of information related to connection IDs in an unbounded queue. Quiche versions 0.19.2 and 0.20.1 are the earliest to address this problem. There is no workaround for affected versions.

CVE-2024-38605,CWE-476,CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

ALSA: core: Fix NULL module pointer assignment at card init

The commit 81033c6b584b (""ALSA: core: Warn on empty module"")
introduced a WARN_ON() for a NULL module pointer passed at snd_card
object creation, and it also wraps the code around it with '#ifdef
MODULE'.  This works in most cases, but the devils are always in
details.  ""MODULE"" is defined when the target code (i.e. the sound
core) is built as a module; but this doesn't mean that the caller is
also built-in or not.  Namely, when only the sound core is built-in
(CONFIG_SND=y) while the driver is a module (CONFIG_SND_USB_AUDIO=m),
the passed module pointer is ignored even if it's non-NULL, and
card->module remains as NULL.  This would result in the missing module
reference up/down at the device open/close, leading to a race with the
code execution after the module removal.

For addressing the bug, move the assignment of card->module again out
of ifdef.  The WARN_ON() is still wrapped with ifdef because the
module can be really NULL when all sound drivers are built-in.

Note that we keep 'ifdef MODULE' for WARN_ON(), otherwise it would
lead to a false-positive NULL module check.  Admittedly it won't catch
perfectly, i.e. no check is performed when CONFIG_SND=y.  But, it's no
real problem as it's only for debugging, and the condition is pretty
rare.",,

The rcuc-starvation output from print_cpu_stall_info() might overflow the
buffer if there is a huge difference in jiffies difference.  The situation
might seem improbable, but computers sometimes get very confused about
time, which can result in full-sized integers, and, in this case,
buffer overflow.

Also, the unsigned jiffies difference is printed using %ld, which is
normally for signed integers.  This is intentional for debugging purposes,
but it is not obvious from the code.

This commit therefore changes sprintf() to snprintf() and adds a
clarifying comment about intention of %ld format.

CVE-2024-5535,,,"Issue summary: Calling the OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto with an
empty supported client protocols buffer may cause a crash or memory contents to
be sent to the peer.

Impact summary: A buffer overread can have a range of potential consequences
such as unexpected application beahviour or a crash. In particular this issue
could result in up to 255 bytes of arbitrary private data from memory being sent
to the peer leading to a loss of confidentiality. However, only applications
that directly call the SSL_select_next_proto function with a 0 length list of
supported client protocols are affected by this issue. This would normally never
be a valid scenario and is typically not under attacker control but may occur by
accident in the case of a configuration or programming error in the calling
application.

The OpenSSL API function SSL_select_next_proto is typically used by TLS
applications that support ALPN (Application Layer Protocol Negotiation) or NPN
(Next Protocol Negotiation). NPN is older, was never standardised and
is deprecated in favour of ALPN. We believe that ALPN is significantly more
widely deployed than NPN. The SSL_select_next_proto function accepts a list of
protocols from the server and a list of protocols from the client and returns
the first protocol that appears in the server list that also appears in the
client list. In the case of no overlap between the two lists it returns the
first item in the client list. In either case it will signal whether an overlap
between the two lists was found. In the case where SSL_select_next_proto is
called with a zero length client list it fails to notice this condition and
returns the memory immediately following the client list pointer (and reports
that there was no overlap in the lists).

This function is typically called from a server side application callback for
ALPN or a client side application callback for NPN. In the case of ALPN the list
of protocols supplied by the client is guaranteed by libssl to never be zero in
length. The list of server protocols comes from the application and should never
normally be expected to be of zero length. In this case if the
SSL_select_next_proto function has been called as expected (with the list
supplied by the client passed in the client/client_len parameters), then the
application will not be vulnerable to this issue. If the application has
accidentally been configured with a zero length server list, and has
accidentally passed that zero length server list in the client/client_len
parameters, and has additionally failed to correctly handle a ""no overlap""
response (which would normally result in a handshake failure in ALPN) then it
will be vulnerable to this problem.

In the case of NPN, the protocol permits the client to opportunistically select
a protocol when there is no overlap. OpenSSL returns the first client protocol
in the no overlap case in support of this. The list of client protocols comes
from the application and should never normally be expected to be of zero length.
However if the SSL_select_next_proto function is accidentally called with a
client_len of 0 then an invalid memory pointer will be returned instead. If the
application uses this output as the opportunistic protocol then the loss of
confidentiality will occur.

This issue has been assessed as Low severity because applications are most
likely to be vulnerable if they are using NPN instead of ALPN - but NPN is not
widely used. It also requires an application configuration or programming error.
Finally, this issue would not typically be under attacker control making active
exploitation unlikely.

The FIPS modules in 3.3, 3.2, 3.1 and 3.0 are not affected by this issue.

Due to the low severity of this issue we are not issuing new releases of
OpenSSL at this time. The fix will be included in the next releases when they
become available.",CWE-200,CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor

CVE-2024-28236,,,"Vela is a Pipeline Automation (CI/CD) framework built on Linux container technology written in Golang. Vela pipelines can use variable substitution combined with insensitive fields like `parameters`, `image` and `entrypoint` to inject secrets into a plugin/image and — by using common substitution string manipulation — can bypass log masking and expose secrets without the use of the commands block. This unexpected behavior primarily impacts secrets restricted by the ""no commands"" option. This can lead to unintended use of the secret value, and increased risk of exposing the secret during image execution bypassing log masking. **To exploit this** the pipeline author must be supplying the secrets to a plugin that is designed in such a way that will print those parameters in logs. Plugin parameters are not designed for sensitive values and are often intentionally printed throughout execution for informational/debugging purposes. Parameters should therefore be treated as insensitive. While Vela provides secrets masking, secrets exposure is not entirely solved by the masking process. A docker image (plugin) can easily expose secrets if they are not handled properly, or altered in some way. There is a responsibility on the end-user to understand how values injected into a plugin are used. This is a risk that exists for many CICD systems (like GitHub Actions) that handle sensitive runtime variables. Rather, the greater risk is that users who restrict a secret to the ""no commands"" option and use image restriction can still have their secret value exposed via substitution tinkering, which turns the image and command restrictions into a false sense of security. This issue has been addressed in version 0.23.2. Users are advised to upgrade. Users unable to upgrade should not provide sensitive values to plugins that can potentially expose them, especially in `parameters` that are not intended to be used for sensitive values, ensure plugins (especially those that utilize shared secrets) follow best practices to avoid logging parameters that are expected to be sensitive, minimize secrets with `pull_request` events enabled, as this allows users to change pipeline configurations and pull in secrets to steps not typically part of the CI process, make use of the build approval setting, restricting builds from untrusted users, and limit use of shared secrets, as they are less restrictive to access by nature.",CWE-532,CWE-532: Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File

A vulnerability has been identified in the Free Scout Application, which exposes SMTP server credentials used by an organization in the application to users of the application.

The sensitive information is then inadvertently disclosed to users via the `/conversation/ajax-html/send_log?folder_id=&thread_id={id}` endpoint. The stack trace reveals value of parameters, including the username and password, passed to the `Swift_Transport_Esmtp_Auth_LoginAuthenticator->authenticate()` function.

CVE-2024-28866,,,"GoCD is a continuous delivery server. GoCD versions from 19.4.0 to 23.5.0 (inclusive) are potentially vulnerable to a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability on the loading page displayed while GoCD is starting, via abuse of a `redirect_to` query parameter with inadequate validation.

Attackers could theoretically abuse the query parameter to steal session tokens or other values from the user's browser. In practice exploiting this to perform privileged actions is likely rather difficult to exploit because the target user would need to be triggered to open an attacker-crafted link in the period where the server is starting up (but not completely started), requiring chaining with a separate denial-of-service vulnerability. Additionally, GoCD server restarts invalidate earlier session tokens (i.e GoCD does not support persistent sessions), so a stolen session token would be unusable once the server has completed restart, and executed XSS would be done within a logged-out context.

The issue is fixed in GoCD 24.1.0. As a workaround, it is technically possible in earlier GoCD versions to override the loading page with an earlier version which is not vulnerable, by starting GoCD with the Java system property override as either `-Dloading.page.resource.path=/loading_pages/default.loading.page.html` (simpler early version of loading page without GoCD introduction) or `-Dloading.page.resource.path=/does_not_exist.html` (to display a simple message with no interactivity).",CWE-79,CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

A wrong validation in the `host_deny` script allows to write any string in the `hosts.deny` file, which can end in an arbitrary command execution on the target system. This vulnerability is part of the active response feature, which can automatically triggers actions in response to alerts. By default, active responses are limited to a set of pre defined executables. This is enforced by only allowing executables stored under `/var/ossec/active-response/bin` to be run as an active response. However, the `/var/ossec/active-response/bin/host_deny` can be exploited. `host_deny` is used to add IP address to the `/etc/hosts.deny` file to block incoming connections on a service level by using TCP wrappers. Attacker can inject arbitrary command into the `/etc/hosts.deny` file and execute arbitrary command by using the spawn directive. The active response can be triggered by writing events either to the local `execd` queue on server or to the `ar` queue which forwards the events to agents. So, it can leads to LPE on server as root and RCE on agent as root. This vulnerability is fixed in 4.7.2.",CWE-94,CWE-94: Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')

Historically calls to __decompress() didn't specify ""out_len"" parameter

uncompressed kernel image are performed. This has changed since commit
2aa14b1ab2c4 (""zstd: import usptream v1.5.2"") which includes zstd library
commit 6a7ede3dfccb (""Reduce size of dctx by reutilizing dst buffer
(#2751)""). Now zstd decompression code might store literal buffer in
the unwritten portion of the destination buffer. Since ""out_len"" is
not set, it is considered to be unlimited and hence free to use for
optimization needs. On s390 this might corrupt initrd or ipl report
which are often placed right after the decompressor buffer. Luckily the
size of uncompressed kernel image is already known to the decompressor,
so to avoid the problem simply specify it in the ""out_len"" parameter.",,

CVE-2023-52765,CWE-476,CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

mfd: qcom-spmi-pmic: Fix revid implementation

The Qualcomm SPMI PMIC revid implementation is broken in multiple ways.

First, it assumes that just because the sibling base device has been
registered that means that it is also bound to a driver, which may not
be the case (e.g. due to probe deferral or asynchronous probe). This
could trigger a NULL-pointer dereference when attempting to access the
driver data of the unbound device.

Second, it accesses driver data of a sibling device directly and without
any locking, which means that the driver data may be freed while it is
being accessed (e.g. on driver unbind).

Third, it leaks a struct device reference to the sibling device which is
looked up using the spmi_device_from_of() every time a function (child)
device is calling the revid function (e.g. on probe).

Fix this mess by reimplementing the revid lookup so that it is done only
at probe of the PMIC device; the base device fetches the revid info from
the hardware, while any secondary SPMI device fetches the information
from the base device and caches it so that it can be accessed safely
from its children. If the base device has not been probed yet then probe
of a secondary device is deferred.",,

An out-of-bounds write exists in the driver for IEEE 802.15.4 radios on nRF platforms in the Contiki-NG operating system. The problem is triggered when parsing radio frames in the `read_frame` function in the `arch/cpu/nrf/net/nrf-ieee-driver-arch.c` module. More specifically, the `read_frame` function performs an incomplete validation of the payload length of the packet, which is a value that can be set by an external party that sends radio packets to a Contiki-NG system. Although the value is validated to be in the range of the MTU length, it is not validated to fit into the given buffer into which the packet will be copied. The problem has been patched in the ""develop"" branch of Contiki-NG and is expected to be included in subsequent releases.

The missing permission is required as an access permission by components in various pre-installed apps. On the TCL 30Z device, the vulnerable app has a package name of com.tcl.screenrecorder (versionCode='1221092802', versionName='v5.2120.02.12008.1.T' ; versionCode='1221092805', versionName='v5.2120.02.12008.2.T'). On the TCL 10L device, the vulnerable app has a package name of com.tcl.sos (versionCode='2020102827', versionName='v3.2014.12.1012.B'). When a third-party app declares and requests the missing permission, it can interact with certain service components in the aforementioned apps (that execute with ""system"" privileges) to perform arbitrary files reads/writes in its context.

No permissions or special privileges are necessary to exploit the vulnerabilities in the com.factory.mmigroup app. No user interaction is required beyond installing and running a third-party app. The software build fingerprints for each confirmed vulnerable device are as follows: Boost Mobile Celero 5G (Celero5G/Jupiter/Jupiter:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW_S98119AA1_V067:user/release-keys, Celero5G/Jupiter/Jupiter:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW_S98119AA1_V064:user/release-keys, Celero5G/Jupiter/Jupiter:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW_S98119AA1_V061:user/release-keys, and Celero5G/Jupiter/Jupiter:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW_S98119AA1_V052:user/release-keys); Samsung Galaxy A03S (samsung/a03sutfn/a03su:13/TP1A.220624.014/S134DLUDU6CWB6:user/release-keys and samsung/a03sutfn/a03su:12/SP1A.210812.016/S134DLUDS5BWA1:user/release-keys); Lenovo Tab M8 HD (Lenovo/LenovoTB-8505F/8505F:10/QP1A.190711.020/S300637_220706_BMP:user/release-keys and Lenovo/LenovoTB-8505F/8505F:10/QP1A.190711.020/S300448_220114_BMP:user/release-keys); T-Mobile Revvl 6 Pro 5G (T-Mobile/Augusta/Augusta:12/SP1A.210812.016/SW_S98121AA1_V070:user/release-keys and T-Mobile/Augusta/Augusta:12/SP1A.210812.016/SW_S98121AA1_V066:user/release-keys); T-Mobile Revvl V+ 5G (T-Mobile/Sprout/Sprout:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW_S98115AA1_V077:user/release-keys and T-Mobile/Sprout/Sprout:11/RP1A.200720.011/SW_S98115AA1_V060:user/release-keys); and Realme C25Y (realme/RMX3269/RED8F6:11/RP1A.201005.001/1675861640000:user/release-keys, realme/RMX3269/RED8F6:11/RP1A.201005.001/1664031768000:user/release-keys, realme/RMX3269/RED8F6:11/RP1A.201005.001/1652814687000:user/release-keys, and realme/RMX3269/RED8F6:11/RP1A.201005.001/1635785712000:user/release-keys). This malicious app sends a broadcast Intent to com.factory.mmigroup/.MMIGroupReceiver. This causes the com.factory.mmigroup app to dynamically register for various action strings. The malicious app can then send these strings, allowing it to perform various behaviors that the com.factory.mmigroup app exposes. The actual behaviors exposed by the com.factory.mmigroup app depend on device model and chipset. The com.factory.mmigroup app executes as the ""system"" user, allowing it to interact with the baseband processor and perform various other sensitive actions.",,

KVM: SVM: fix missing sev_decommission in sev_receive_start

DECOMMISSION the current SEV context if binding an ASID fails after
RECEIVE_START.  Per AMD's SEV API, RECEIVE_START generates a new guest
context and thus needs to be paired with DECOMMISSION:

     The RECEIVE_START command is the only command other than the LAUNCH_START

The missing DECOMMISSION can result in subsequent SEV launch failures,
as the firmware leaks memory and might not able to allocate more SEV
guest contexts in the future.

nexthop: Fix memory leaks in nexthop notification chain listeners

syzkaller discovered memory leaks [1] that can be reduced to the
following commands:

 # ip nexthop add id 1 blackhole
 # devlink dev reload pci/0000:06:00.0

As part of the reload flow, mlxsw will unregister its netdevs and then
unregister from the nexthop notification chain. Before unregistering
from the notification chain, mlxsw will receive delete notifications for
nexthop objects using netdevs registered by mlxsw or their uppers. mlxsw
will not receive notifications for nexthops using netdevs that are not
dismantled as part of the reload flow. For example, the blackhole
nexthop above that internally uses the loopback netdev as its nexthop
device.

One way to fix this problem is to have listeners flush their nexthop
tables after unregistering from the notification chain. This is
error-prone as evident by this patch and also not symmetric with the
registration path where a listener receives a dump of all the existing
nexthops.

Therefore, fix this problem by replaying delete notifications for the
listener being unregistered. This is symmetric to the registration path
and also consistent with the netdev notification chain.

The above means that unregister_nexthop_notifier(), like
register_nexthop_notifier(), will have to take RTNL in order to iterate
over the existing nexthops and that any callers of the function cannot
hold RTNL. This is true for mlxsw and netdevsim, but not for the VXLAN
driver. To avoid a deadlock, change the latter to unregister its nexthop
listener without holding RTNL, making it symmetric to the registration
path.

In commit 24803f38a5c0 (""igmp: do not remove igmp souce list info when set
link down""), the ip_mc_clear_src() in ip_mc_destroy_dev() was removed,
because it was also called in igmpv3_clear_delrec().

Rough callgraph:

inetdev_destroy
-> ip_mc_destroy_dev
     -> igmpv3_clear_delrec
        -> ip_mc_clear_src
-> RCU_INIT_POINTER(dev->ip_ptr, NULL)

However, ip_mc_clear_src() called in igmpv3_clear_delrec() doesn't
release in_dev->mc_list->sources. And RCU_INIT_POINTER() assigns the
NULL to dev->ip_ptr. As a result, in_dev cannot be obtained through
inetdev_by_index() and then in_dev->mc_list->sources cannot be released
by ip_mc_del1_src() in the sock_close. Rough call sequence goes like:

sock_close
-> __sock_release
   -> inet_release
      -> ip_mc_drop_socket
         -> inetdev_by_index
         -> ip_mc_leave_src
            -> ip_mc_del_src
               -> ip_mc_del1_src

So we still need to call ip_mc_clear_src() in ip_mc_destroy_dev() to free
in_dev->mc_list->sources.",,

s390/qeth: fix NULL deref in qeth_clear_working_pool_list()

When qeth_set_online() calls qeth_clear_working_pool_list() to roll
back after an error exit from qeth_hardsetup_card(), we are at risk of
accessing card->qdio.in_q before it was allocated by
qeth_alloc_qdio_queues() via qeth_mpc_initialize().

qeth_clear_working_pool_list() then dereferences NULL, and by writing to
queue->bufs[i].pool_entry scribbles all over the CPU's lowcore.
Resulting in a crash when those lowcore areas are used next (eg. on
the next machine-check interrupt).

Such a scenario would typically happen when the device is first set
online and its queues aren't allocated yet. An early IO error or certain
misconfigs (eg. mismatched transport mode, bad portno) then cause us to
error out from qeth_hardsetup_card() with card->qdio.in_q still being
NULL.

Fix it by checking the pointer for NULL before accessing it.

Note that we also have (rare) paths inside qeth_mpc_initialize() where
a configuration change can cause us to free the existing queues,
expecting that subsequent code will allocate them again. If we then
error out before that re-allocation happens, the same bug occurs.

mlxsw: thermal: Fix out-of-bounds memory accesses

Currently, mlxsw allows cooling states to be set above the maximum
cooling state supported by the driver:

 # cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/type
 mlxsw_fan
 # cat /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/max_state
 10
 # echo 18 > /sys/class/thermal/thermal_zone2/cdev0/cur_state

 0

This results in out-of-bounds memory accesses when thermal state
transition statistics are enabled (CONFIG_THERMAL_STATISTICS=y), as the
transition table is accessed with a too large index (state) [1].

According to the thermal maintainer, it is the responsibility of the
driver to reject such operations [2].

Therefore, return an error when the state to be set exceeds the maximum
cooling state supported by the driver.

To avoid dead code, as suggested by the thermal maintainer [3],
partially revert commit a421ce088ac8 (""mlxsw: core: Extend cooling
device with cooling levels"") that tried to interpret these invalid
cooling states (above the maximum) in a special way. The cooling levels
array is not removed in order to prevent the fans going below 20% PWM,
which would cause them to get stuck at 0% PWM.

net: stmmac: dwmac-rk: fix oob read in rk_gmac_setup

KASAN reports an out-of-bounds read in rk_gmac_setup on the line:

	while (ops->regs[i]) {

This happens for most platforms since the regs flexible array member is
empty, so the memory after the ops structure is being read here.  It
seems that mostly this happens to contain zero anyway, so we get lucky
and everything still works.

To avoid adding redundant data to nearly all the ops structures, add a
new flag to indicate whether the regs field is valid and avoid this loop

CVE-2021-47482,CWE-544,CWE-544 Missing Standardized Error Handling Mechanism,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

net: batman-adv: fix error handling

Syzbot reported ODEBUG warning in batadv_nc_mesh_free(). The problem was
in wrong error handling in batadv_mesh_init().

Before this patch batadv_mesh_init() was calling batadv_mesh_free() in case
of any batadv_*_init() calls failure. This approach may work well, when
there is some kind of indicator, which can tell which parts of batadv are
initialized; but there isn't any.

All written above lead to cleaning up uninitialized fields. Even if we hide
ODEBUG warning by initializing bat_priv->nc.work, syzbot was able to hit
GPF in batadv_nc_purge_paths(), because hash pointer in still NULL. [1]

To fix these bugs we can unwind batadv_*_init() calls one by one.
It is good approach for 2 reasons: 1) It fixes bugs on error handling
path 2) It improves the performance, since we won't call unneeded
batadv_*_free() functions.

So, this patch makes all batadv_*_init() clean up all allocated memory
before returning with an error to no call correspoing batadv_*_free()
and open-codes batadv_mesh_free() with proper order to avoid touching
uninitialized fields.",,
CVE-2021-47230,CWE-476,CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

KVM: x86: Immediately reset the MMU context when the SMM flag is cleared

Immediately reset the MMU context when the vCPU's SMM flag is cleared so
that the SMM flag in the MMU role is always synchronized with the vCPU's
flag.  If RSM fails (which isn't correctly emulated), KVM will bail
without calling post_leave_smm() and leave the MMU in a bad state.

The bad MMU role can lead to a NULL pointer dereference when grabbing a
shadow page's rmap for a page fault as the initial lookups for the gfn
will happen with the vCPU's SMM flag (=0), whereas the rmap lookup will
use the shadow page's SMM flag, which comes from the MMU (=1).  SMM has
an entirely different set of memslots, and so the initial lookup can find
a memslot (SMM=0) and then explode on the rmap memslot lookup (SMM=1).

CVE-2021-4440,CWE-400,CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption,"In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved:

x86/xen: Drop USERGS_SYSRET64 paravirt call

commit afd30525a659ac0ae0904f0cb4a2ca75522c3123 upstream.

USERGS_SYSRET64 is used to return from a syscall via SYSRET, but
a Xen PV guest will nevertheless use the IRET hypercall, as there
is no sysret PV hypercall defined.

So instead of testing all the prerequisites for doing a sysret and
then mangling the stack for Xen PV again for doing an iret just use
the iret exit from the beginning.

This can easily be done via an ALTERNATIVE like it is done for the
sysenter compat case already.

It should be noted that this drops the optimization in Xen for not
restoring a few registers when returning to user mode, but it seems
as if the saved instructions in the kernel more than compensate for
this drop (a kernel build in a Xen PV guest was slightly faster with
this patch applied).

While at it remove the stale sysret32 remnants.

  [ pawan: Brad Spengler and Salvatore Bonaccorso <carnil@debian.org>
	   reported a problem with the 5.10 backport commit edc702b4a820
	   (""x86/entry_64: Add VERW just before userspace transition"").

	   When CONFIG_PARAVIRT_XXL=y, CLEAR_CPU_BUFFERS is not executed in
	   syscall_return_via_sysret path as USERGS_SYSRET64 is runtime
	   patched to:

	.cpu_usergs_sysret64    = { 0x0f, 0x01, 0xf8,
				    0x48, 0x0f, 0x07 }, // swapgs; sysretq

	   which is missing CLEAR_CPU_BUFFERS. It turns out dropping
	   USERGS_SYSRET64 simplifies the code, allowing CLEAR_CPU_BUFFERS
	   to be explicitly added to syscall_return_via_sysret path. Below
